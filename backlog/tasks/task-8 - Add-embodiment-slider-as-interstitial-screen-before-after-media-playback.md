## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement an interstitial screen that shows the embodiment slider before any media starts playing and after it completes. This creates a mindful transition moment for users to check in with their embodiment state.

The interstitial should:
- Display before media playback begins
- Display after media playback completes
- Include a "Skip" button to bypass and go straight to media
- Include a "Continue" button to proceed after user has adjusted the slider
- Work with all media types (video, audio/mp3)
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->
